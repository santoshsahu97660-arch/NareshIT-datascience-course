== 

generative ai vs agentic ai 

sample demo -- you just listen today & practise 

day after tomorrow onward bi

typing -- 10 min 
15mint -- softskills 
chatgpt -- build calculator app 
geneatvei ai -- geneate the code 
user -- copy the code past in software then app will generate 

generatie ai generate text, content, code, etc 

agentic ai --- 
smolagents 

generative ai vs agentic ai 

generatie ai generate text, content, code, etc  |
		user or developer copy the code past the build project 
		
agentic ai --> agent write the code, validation , bug fixes every thing is done by agent 

2025-- many company layoff ( fired manager,experince, )
manager - done by chagt, agentic ai frameworsk 

all experience must should learn agentic ai 

ai not kill the job
learners who learn ai they automized the job 

generative ai models are divide into 2 part -->

1- text based model (user enter text -- model generate text) 
2- text to image | text to audio | text to video -- multimodel 

SyntaxError: invalid syntax 
syntax error -- erro which happens from user side or developer 


270000 inr without recording ( nit doesnot provid recording)

3- you will get new link 

---
Agenda for today session -->
--
1- recap what are the concept we concept we covered yesterday
2- concept data type 
3- one student placement happened recently 
4- how to download the class notes on regular basis & How to upoload your 

except True , False, None 
---
syntax -->
---
variable name = value 
value = datatypes 

python important datatypes

	integer
	float
	bool
	string
	complex 
variable - every
function always ends with () 

3function I define hear 

family() -- this family fun with no argument 
family1(d, m) --> family1 2 argument or parameter 
family2(d, m, s, d) -- family 4 argument or parameter 


variable & function 

german_cars(bmw, audi, mer, fer, lambo) 
asina_cars(tata, mahindra, maruthi)


if user or developer want to get more then 1 output -- use print()
if use print only 1 output (not required) 

variable 
function()
functional argument | function parameter 
python operator == + ,- , * 

 
int - value without decimal
float - value with decimal
float only e letter is allowed 
string -- always declare with '' || " " | ''' '''

	 ''' -- we used for multiline comments 
complex -- a + bj 
	a - real part | b - imaginary part | j - squre root of -1 
	
==== 16th 
+91 9154861173 - Mr.Areef  & i will share the qr code at last 
qr code -- course syllbus, recording lecture 

we install software IDE 
	VS CODE 
	ANACONDA -- JUPYTER & SPYDER 
	
I will share the link please instlal & let me know if you have any issue 


python interpreter -- run or excute the code line by line or part of the code 
python compiler -- entire code run at once  
python is both ( interpretter or compiler) both programming language 

ide ( integrated development environment)
	using ide user or developer can run the code, write the code, fix the error 

which ide we installed 
	vs code ide 
	jupyter ide 
	spyder ide 
	pycharm ide 

using ide we build ml project, ai project, gen ai project, cicd , mlops, 

Other datatypes to int -- completed 

1- All other datatypes to integer 
float to int -- possible | bool to int - possible | number string to valid but text string to int - invalid 
		type casting we cannot cast or convert text string to int | complex to int | user cannot define 2 argument at once

2- All Other datatypes to float 
int to float -- possible | bool to float - possible | number string to float valid but text string to float - invalid 
		type casting we cannot cast or convert text string to float | complex to float | user cannot define 2 argument at once	
	
3- All other datatype to string 
	all other datatype to string | no issue at all 
	
4- All other datatype to Bool
	non zero argument if you define bydefaulat it will detect as true 
	zero argument then it will detect false 
	we can type cast from all other data types to bool 

5- All other dataypes to complex
	complex - only 1 string will be allowed as parameter 
	
== python type casting we are completed today

=== 16th
if you are non tech you never code before 

1st -- what ever document I will share to please watch it and complete 
2nd -- same coder after 30min -- donot watch and write ( 1day, 2day, 3day, 30min) 
3rd -- after 3day ( write win10min) 

how to transit non technical - technical ( use 1 code -- 3times, 4th time just view) 

everyday -  I need your time to make you success 

=== 17th 

- did you got google classroom acces 
	if you dident get please get the access quick from offline admin or online adming

	mentor vs mentor vs faculy 
after the class if you have any question please ask to mentor if you stuck some bugs 
online link, annoucment, relavent to your payment -- admin

=== python introduction
=== python variable
=== python datatypes 
=== python typecasting 
=== PYTHON DATASTRUCTURE 
	list 
	tuple
	set
	dict 

Datatype vs Datastrcture 

DATA TYPE -- USER CAN declare only 1 value 
DATA STRUCTURE -- user can declare more then 1 value is called data structure
 
e - exponential 
only e is allowed no other character are allowed 

what is mean be datatype 
what is mean by datastructure 
what is mean by matrix = 1d, 2d, nd 
what is mean by table == rows & columns 

datatype - int, float, string, complex, bool 
lets explore more on string part 

id() -- address of the memory allocation 
a = 10 ( system memory id has crate with some location 
---
INDEXING -->
---
	forward index - left index to right index ( start from 0) 
	backward index -- right index to left index ( starting from -1) 
	step index -- 


iq -- python ( can you please reverse the string) | indexing concept 

fun() -- 2 types 
	inbuild function -- print() id() len()
	user define function 

---
slicing --> : 
--
	forward slicing 
	backward slicing 
	step slicing 


online & Offline I humble request you please listen to me what I am saying
doesnot what error you got () your 

==== 18th
python basic operator 
python bitwise operator 

in the market you see add full stack genearive ai & agentici course 
advaned gen ai & agentic ai 

you reach out to the right place -- day by 
my teaching + your learning + your practise + interview = resule = offer 

no. of variable = no. of values 

1- Arithmetic operator -- +, -, *, /, //, %, ** 
2- Assignment operator =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=
3- Relational operator >, <, >=, <=, ==, != 
4- Logical operator , and, or, not 
5- Unary operator - only 1 operator - (minus) 

online team -- every learning i want to tell you one thing 
	as you new the way -- keep worry about what eve your braing through question 
Online team i am speacking you are doing somehting -- after you cloass you drop off 
---
Truth table -->
---
and --> 1 and 1 is 1 rest of them are 0  
or --> 0 or - is 0 restr of them are 1 
not 

python basic operator we are completed 
python bitwise operator 
	complement operator 
	and operator 
	or operator 
	xor (xclusive or) 
	left shift 
	right shift 
	
if you are speed in typeing then please work with me on regular classes 
if you are slow in typing just focus listen thats enought( after the class please practicse)

these are fundametne i am speakin g( prob, distr, gau, action, optimizaet, r2, )  -- 
everyday is not easy concept 

complement operator ( ~)  = it store -ve values in the memory 

how to download the class notes 
do not worry about many hordking , manyu, advance genai, agentic ai , 

i will teach more advance -- you & leave i will 

before i will explain bitwise i forget to expaling number system 

python number system first then we will go for bitwise operator 
python number system -->

	1- binary number system (0b) ~ base 2 ( 0, 1) 
	2- octal number system (0o) base 8 ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) 
	3- decimal number system (0x)   base 10 (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) 
	4- hexadecimal number syste (0xa,b,c,d,e,f)  based16 
						0-9 
						a - 10
						b - 11
						c - 12
						d - 13
						e - 14
						f - 15
						 
1:30hr listen the class & store in your brain gain
practise the class from the brain 
keep giving interview 
every interview you will fail 
you will clearn 1st round , 1st roun will fiak
clear 1st, 2ndround clearn again 2 nd round will fail 
20-30time 
1-- 1st, 2nd , hr -- selected but still they dont give offer 
finaly 1 offer is waiting for you which gods plance 

you will stop giving interview 

keep giving interve- fail - ignore untill offer is sitting in your gmail box 
never trust any -- HR never ever trust 
never ever backdorr -- client will send you frontdoor 
2l -- they ( client meeting ) never ever give money to any consultan 

== share me github in classroom
 
=== 21st 

everyday I will share the documnent, code explanation, code or project
So immedietly download all the thigs to your desktop  ( daily basis)

I will share today sat & today class explanation 

bin() -- 2 | oct() - 8 | decimal (10) hex - 16

why we are learning this 


we are learning basic python 
advance python 
oops python 
project ml , ai, dl project 

list of topics -- 
intorduce to pythin, python identifier, datatypes, typecasting, basic operator, number system 

bitwise operator 
	complement operator - done  
	and operator - done 
	or operator - done 
	xor (xclusive or) - done 
	left shift << 
	right shift >> 

computer vision project 

machine which device recognize your face 
to build these project we want hese python learning 

today we are complete python operator, bitwise operator 
----
print() in python -->
-----
fun()

print() user can pass 1 argument, or n number of argument 

1- print result with string 
2- print Format method ( .format() number of variable == {} 
	if you define 2 variable -- 2 
3- f string method
4- end statement 
5- separator 



if some feels not understnain -- that's mean not listenging class 
if you are note -- all the notes ( practise)
ask to the mentor ( chagpt)
ask me I will explain 


Everyday you need to revise previous class 
Every week end of the day please revise weekly classes 

==== 22nd 

python datatype -- user define only 1 value | a = 5, b = 5.5
python datastructure -- user define more then 1 value or 1 elements 
a = 2,3,4
	
	Inbuild ds ( primitive ) - LIST, 
				   TUPLE, 
				   SET, 
				   DICT, 
				   RANGE 
	user define ds (non primitive)
				STACK
				LINKEDLIST 
				ARRAY 
				TREE  
 all user define data structure will take care by some library or framework 

without learning inbuild data structure  we never build any project 


List -->
  .append() - add the element at last 
  .copy() - copy one list to another list 
  list is mutable ( user can change any elements or any items)
  indexing is allowed in the list 
  slicing is allowed in the list 
  duplicate are allowed 

items, values, element, member 

index & slicing -->
	forward index 
	backward index 
	step index 

: -->  print all element = value = items == memeber

2:4 --> print element starting from 2nd index till n-1 3rd index
		right side only applicable n-1 

:4 --> starting index from 0th index to 3rd index 

4: --> starting from 4th index till last 

0:10:3 --> print index 0th index to 9th but print every 3rd index count skip other index 

::3 --> print start to last index print only 3rd index 

::-1 --> print the elements reverse 

::-2 --> print the element reverse -2 index position 

everyday you will recved codes & document 

code extension always ends with.py or.ipynb 

==== 23rd 

remove()- removed the first occurance of an item 
 call 3 time remove function 

list inside the list - nested list 
for loop inside for -- nested for 
while loop insiode while - nested while 


do not work if you are slow in typing 
just focus the class 1:20 min 
after the class what ever foucs please practicel with lapto 3hr 
day you spend 4.30 -- real learning 

remove() - remove the element from the list  by mentioned values to it 
pop() -- remove the element from the list mention index rateher element 

parameter ( system given default parameter)  | inbuild == builtin 
hyperparamter (user change the system parameter) | user remove w10-w11 ( hyperparameter) 
hyperparameter in generative ai we called hyperparamter tunning == finetuning  

sort() --
	user need to pass similar datatype to sort the elemnt or else it will give bugs 

: -- 4 spaces 
spaces technically we called as indentation 

intro to for loop 

if 0 value is present in the list all- false & any() - true 
if 0 value is not present in the list all & any -- print as true 

=== 24th 
Tuple = () 

list is mutable 
tuple is immutable 

john == [10, 20k,30k, 40k] 
mike = (10,20,30) 

list & tuple we are completed 


set & dict both assigned with {} 
for empty set user set() 

add()- add the element randomly to the set 

append() vs add()
discard() vs remove()
list vs tuple 


Set indexig & slicing is not allowed 

set 

skils -- project -- resume -- job markt -- interview -- fail - 1st rount -- reject 
	2nd roung -- reject -- hr round -- stop -- 20 interview -- 21st is offer 

20th you will interview 
21st give up 
next interview is offer -- next next offer 

keep giving interview -- keep fail - don't complain -- just move on -- get offer 
offer also -- keep giving interview -- hiring & firing 

=== SET OPERATION 

union 
intersection 
difference 
symmetric difference 
=== 

question on function, classes please do not work 
rest of them please complete -

difference vs symmetric difference 
---
set operation -->
--
union |
intersection &
difference -
symmetric difference ^ 
symmetric difference update 

== superset , subset, disjoint 
== superclass, subclass 


superset -- dad 
subset -- son 
disjoint - neighbour 

=== set is completed ====

python datastrucutre -- List, tuple, set , dict & range 
print() with foramat methid, separator, end, escape
string
===== Python Dictionary
keys : values 
keys will be more important then vales 
keys -- int, float, string, bool, compl 
values -- you can define any data type to it 

fresher, exper, leader, rich 

I will explain daily, please complete the task move on 

=== 28th

package = library | 	collection of module 
module == collection of function 
function == collection of statement 
	inbuild func
	user def function 

package -- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc------ 

math module 
	add()
	sub()
	mul()

my 1.30 hr session -- 2day 

1- Rename the string 'fine' to 'dine'
2-  help() -- prompt will appeare -- q to exit 
		https://docs.python.org/3.12/tutorial/
3- inbuild function 
	print(), 
	len()
	type() 
	id()- address of the memory location 
		who assigned the memory location 
that guys is constructor  ( __init__) 

4- python concept there is no concept constanc 
	python is always variable concept 

5- swap variable in python 
	using 3rd variable we are swap it 

	don't use 3rd varibal 
	using add, sub 
	a, b = b, a 

6- how to import any module in python by using keyword called import 
	import math
	floor 
	ceil 

7- import 
math 
math 
math 

brb  be right back

import -- 
as --
from -- 



from dmart import food, clothing 

optimization meaning -- reduce the code  line and minimum lines to speed up code to 
	open frontend application 

8. Run python code using cli (command line interpreter )
	open the text file 
	write few line code & save to .py file 
	cmd - cd desktop -- python test.py 
	see your result 

who ever got error try to check the path 
if any one got error don't be panic, don't be anger 

if error come -- try to think why the error how to fix the error 
	try your self if your not fix please rech out to mentor 

=== 29th 

9- input() from tomorrow 
input() bydefault read string only 

1. input() we entered numbers 
2. input() we enter string & indexing & slicing in input() 
3. input() expression 
	5 + 8 - 3
4- eval in input() 
	eval we are using to handle expression
----
BASIC PYTHON WE ARE COMPLETED TODAY -->
-----
1- variable syntax -- var = value | value called as datatype 
2- data type 
3- type casting 
4- python basic operator ( arithment,assignment,relation,unary,logical) 
5- bitwise operat(complement,and, or, xor, left shift, right shift) 
6- bitwise number system 
7- pkg, module, inbuild function - print, len, id, max, min, 
8- print() with format method, print{} no of variable == no. of curly 
9- data structure - list, tuple, set, dict, range 
10- math module 
11- keywords from, as, import 
12- optimization ( reduce the code lines to speed up your application) 
13- parameter vs hyperparameter
14- input() | number, string, expression is eval
15- string question  
16- work python code using cli & using sys . argv 

basic python we are completed 

=== NUMPY 

NumPy (Numerical Python) 

pkg - collection of module 
module - collection of function 
function -- collection of statement

NUMPY - pkg 

array -- arrays will handel by numpy librar or numpy packages

numpy - is the library which we used to handle data anlysis, datsceicne,
	gen ai, computer vision project to handle nd array

NUMPY -- which handles multidimension array 
	1d 
	2d 
	nd array 
----
Numpy usages -->
----
arithmetic operation
statistical operation
bitwise operator 
copying & viewing array
stacking 
matrix operation 
linear algebra
broadcasting
math operation 
searching, sorting, counting

array vs vector 

numbers -- statics -- numerical data 
text --statics --- categorical data 

homogeneous -- similar data types 
heterogenous -- different data types 

pip install numpy 

anaconda -- numpy are interlly installed 
vs code -- pip install numpy

tomorrow I will schedule 1 test | try to test yourself how much knowledge you have  

everyday few student are missing the regular class -- they are practising, they not even 
they not open laptop -- they don't 


: -- will parse row or colum 
, -- specic value and give the outputs 

---
 numpy operation -->
---


whenenver : == right index must be apply as n-1 formual 
, -- n-1 formula is not required 


slcing & advanced slcing in array  

* == all function import internally 

np.tabl  217 function we have in numpy 

from numpy import * -- all the function called internally 
selct * from table

----
Numpy indexing -->
----


from an array how to parse rows & how to parse columns 
mat[3] -- print 3rd row
mat[:,3] -- print 3rd column 
mat[3,:] -- also print 3rd rows 
---
Numpy masking ( filter in numpy) -->
---

if you have recording -- you are best person 
non technique -- 1 time . you must need to listen 2 time 

recording --- watch ( very much clearn) 
listern 
stats == ml algorithm -- youutbe , chat gpt ( skipp , skip )

after complete 6 month ? yes
nareshit you saw 

-- summarization for numpy crash course 
1- what is 1d, 2d, nd 
2- indexing & slicing in numpy 
3- , & :

yesterday I shared some numpy documentation to you 
please complete the doces which I am give n to uou 

NUMPY is one of the important concept 
	ml, nlp, ai, dl, gen ai, prompt engineer, agentic ai module 


what ever easy function please finish -- tough leave that ( after 3 month) when you watch you can solve 


what is array how to convert array 

image to array  --

we learn how to read image from path location 

when you work with ml , dl, ai -- NUMPY 
generative , llm , -- pytorch 

NUMPY -- convert to array 
pytorch -- convert to tensor

if the data is so big python cannot visualize even though visualization does not make sense 
that's we introduce to BI TOOL ( POWER BI OR TABLEAU) 
	
python is programming lanague , 
python you can plot the graph limit, data clean, algorithm, 

sql vs python 
sql -- you cannot do visualization 
python -- 
python graphis are limited ( power bi )

loops are 2 types 
- while loop & for loop 
- while else & for else 

in other program , they do not have concept while else or for else 
only concept in python is for else & while else   


when to use while loop & when to use for loop

while loop -- use when we have condition 
for loop -- use when we have data sequence -- (datatype, datastructure)

# can python code to print 5 table 

BREAK  - break the loop based on condition 
CONTINUE -- continue lop skp the condition 
PASS -- pass the bug or error 

pass -- abstract method, -- abstraction in oops , method overriding 
break & continue -- computer vision project

=== INTRODUCE TO SQL & SQL SERVER 

data could be anything -- number, text, pdf, image, video, car, bike, 
data must store - container | database 
database -- any once can insert data, extract delate, add new data 

data -- 3 type 

structure data = labelled data == supervised learning 
	 Data is in excel file, csv file 
		domain banking database -- insurance, 

unstructured data = unlabelled data = unsupervised learning 
	image,  video, text, pdf, audio 
	unstructured creates from internet 

semi structure data == semi supervised learning 
	number + Image 
	mix of structure + unstructured 

Reinforcement learning ==
	machine are interact with environment 



what is data 
what is database
what is sl , ul, semi, reinforcement learning 

# server = collection of datbases 
	server will setup in server room inpremises 
		production server (prod server)
		application server (app server) 

# database == collection of table 

# table == collection (records)rows * column 

# database -- data store in table 
# cloud -- data store in datacentre 
	cloud based provder

Raw data and clean data 
what would be the how ( how to you fetch the data set from db)

data analytics or data scientist 

every developer or every data scientist must works with dataset ( excel sheet) 

RAW DATA - which contains missing values 
CLEAN DATA -- 

convert raw data - clean data is called data cleaning or data cleansing 


excel sheet -- database 

database raw data or clean data 

data analyst are those who clean from unclean data to clean data

explain the project piplline ?

PARENT OF MACHINE LEARING | FOUNDATION OF MACHINE LEARN 

FOUNDATION - EDA | 1ST FLOOR - ML | 2ND - AI | 3RD GEN AI AGENT 

How eda will integrate to machine learning 

architecture to build ml prediction model 

---
EDA  Technique -->
---
1- variable identification
2- univariate analysis
3- bivariate analysis
4- outlier treatment
5- missing value treatment 
6- imputation technique (transformer) 
7- variable creation

Eda technique == feature engineering technique 
---
1- variable identification 
---
independent variable == non target attribute == non labelled attribute = non predictive variab
x
dependent variable == target attribute == labele attribte = predictive variable == y 

family(4 variable) 
	
dad - employee -- dv -- y

mom - housewife - iv (x1)
1kid - 4th grade - iv (x2)
2kid - 2nd grade - iv (x3) 

y = x1 + x2 + x3 ( multiple lineare regression algorithm) 

family 
	dad (y)
	mom (x)
	kid (x2)
y =x1+ x2

==== Machine Learning 

regression -- if dv is continuous  variable 
	petrol price 
	stock price 
	gold price 
	flight ticket price
	ev car sale 
	rent price 
	house price 
	land price 
	crypto 
	company sale 

REGRESSION ALGORITHM -->

	SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION 
	MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION 
	Gradient descent | stochastic gd | Batch gd
	L1 regression | lasso regualarization 
	L2 regression | ridge regualarization
	polynomial regression 
	support vector regressor 
	k nearest neighbour regression 
	decision tree regreasor
	random forest regression algorithm
	xgboost regression (xtream gradient boost)
	lgbm( light gradient boosting) regression 
	artificial neural network  regressoin
	time series 
	
Classification -- dv is binary or category 
	win | loose (1 - 0) 
	profit | loss
	cat | dog 
	happy | sad
	cool | not cool
	spam | non spam
	purchas | nopt 
	pass | fail 
	yes | no 
	

clustering -- no dv 

1st priority is always dependent variable 

1- variable identification 
	iv(x1,x2,---xn)
	dv (y)
	relavant attribute 
	non relavant attribute  
	

while build ml model please do not consider irralavant attribute consider only relavant attribute 

1st point -- we cleared 

2- univariate analysis - plot the graph using 1 variable is called univariate 

3- bivariate anlaysis - plot the graph using 2 variable is called bivariate 
	corelation -- relation among is attribute corelation 

+Ve corr
-ve corr
0 corr

corelation range is -1 to 1
+Ve core  0-1 
-ve corr -=1 to 0 

4- outlier detection 
	how to detect outlier ( by visualization) 

5,6, 7

=== frontend ( streamlit) 
=== frontend (tkinter)

=== 21st


4- Missing value treatment 
	number (numerical data) 
	text (categorical data)

In the dataset if any numerical values are missing we need to implement
	mean strategy
	median 
	mode
5- if any missing values are absent in the dataset 
	numerical value  are missing -- mean, median, mode
	categorical value are missing -- mode or knn 

6- imputation also called transformer 
	impute categorical data to numerical data is called transformer | imputation 
	DUMMY VARIABLE OR ONE HOT ENCODER

skewness -- where the data is stay at left side, right side, center 


+Ve skew == mean>median & Mode == data is stay at left side & outlier is at right
-ve skew == mode > median > mean == data is stay at right side & outlier is at left
0skew == mean = median = model == data is stay at center & no outlier 

which type of skew == 0 skew ( no outlier) 

0 skew == normal distribution = gausian distribution = bel curve = 0 symmetry 
ml model also we need to considered --- 0 skew ( normal distribution)

stock, cricket, foot, hospital, insuran -- graphs ( keys to understand goal of business)

you write once but call multiple times 

inbuild function() -- print(), type(), len(), id(), max(),min(),foor(), ceil()
user define fun() 
	-- using help def keyword we will define function

syntax of the fun()

	def fun_name():
            print('hi;)
	fun_name() 

code optimiztation ( all dsa learning to make the code very less fast performance) 

car(bmw) -- 1 argument 
cars(bmw, audi) - 2 argument

when ever you guys working with def function 
rather then print you need to use return keyword 


function without argument 
function with argument
function with print() vs fun with return 
we always need to go for return keywords 
function will very helpful to write multiple operation in the code 
define the function once but call as much as time

=== FUNCTION ARGUMENT IS DIVIDIED INTO 2 PART 
1- Formal argument 
2- Actual argument
	positional argument -- clear 
	keyword argument 
	default argument
	variable length argument
	kwargs ( keyword + variable length) 


==== 2nd 

actual argument

what ever topic I am explaining right now same topic or same concept will
repeate agin in method overloading 

method overloading is the conpcet of polymorphism 
polymorphism is the subject comes from oops 

local variable
global variable
global keyword 
global() 

if we didn't call the function then global variable 
	
to get output local variable we must need to call the function 
if we don't call the function system bydefaul consider global variable 

local vs global 
local -- in function | global - out function 

can I make global variable to local yes ( global keyword) 

local - state govt jobs
	no jobs in state will you apply central job 
global - central govt job 


globl keyword inside function \ that mena local will convereted to global

==== (ANONYMOUS FUNCTION == LAMBDA FUNCTION)

FUNCTION ( lambda function) 

project develpe fun only vs lambda func

lambda function -- would help to speed up the code 
front end website will open very fast user

lambda function -- we use to reduce the code line 
function -- 10 line of code 
lambda - 7 line 

lambda is another keyword or reserve word

lambda function -->
	filter  - done 
	map - 
	reduce

Roll 1 dice -- Uniform distribution 
Roll 2 dice -- Normal distribution == gaussian distribution = bell curve == 0 symmetrty 



Standardization = Z score   || we can use in ml and also in time series 

machine learning == z score ( standardization) 
time series zscore = White noise 

what is mean z-score ( mean-0 & sd -1 ) is called z-score 


inferential stats
	prob, distribution
	z-score 
	confidence interval 

95% confident today virat ko - 100 
99% confident Rohit alsow score - 100 

test case sa re pass 

95% confident math exam score ( 90-95) 
99% confident math exam (92-98) 


97-- 99% test case are pass 
92 - 95% test case are pass 

assumption == reality 

error = 5% (alpha) - p-value 

5% = 5/100 - 0.05 considerd as p-value 


z-score == standardization technique to convert mean - 0 & sd - 1
p-value == p-value significanve value which require to compute to check hypothesis 
error term is called alpha
95% confident -- 
99% confident -- 

confidence interval lower bound & upper bound -- estimator 
mean of the estimator -- estimates 

confidence interval 2 part  
	population variance known == z-test 
	population variance unknow == sample == t-test 

z-test 
t-test 
z-score 

ml -- always we consider sample data that's why we never get z we always get t-test

==== 
REGRESSION -- we will build regression model to predict stock price or gold price 

CLASSIFICAITON -- we will build classification model to predict profit or loss 
		after we build classification model we need to check accuracy 
		to check accuracy & error rate we will be using TYPE1 & TYPE2 error 
		type1 & type2 error is part of confusion matrix 
		confusion matrix -- TP, TN , FP, FN 


REGRESSION LINE 
	Y = MX + C
	Y^ = MX + C 

X- independent variable
y- dependent variable = actual point 
c - constant 
m - +Ve slope 
y^ = predicted point


SKLEARN --SCKIT LEARN FOR ML & STATS

ERROR = loss function = cost function = actual - predicted  

x = independent datapoint (actual value)
y = depdendete data points (actual value)
y^ = predicted data points  (predicted value) 
y- = average of all the y datatpoints 
m = slope 
c = constatant | intercept 


3- anova ( analysis of varaiance)  
	SSR ( sum of square regressor) == predicted point - average point 
	SSE ( sum of squre error) == actual - predicted
	SST (sum of squer total)  == actal - average 
		sst = sse + ssr 

R2 & Adjusted R2 
R2 = 1 - ssr / sst 


ml regression part & classification part 

performance measure of regression model is R2 & ADJUSTED R2 
		range of r2 & adjusted r2 0-1 
		r2 > adjusted r2 
	then only we can find the regression model is best model 

performance measure of classification is confusion matrix

	by add more relavant attribute 


5- What is the technique to reduce overfitting problem 
	we have few techniqu  to remove the irrelevant attribute 
	
   1- Regularization technique 
   2- cross validation 
   3- pca ( principal component analysis)
   4- drop out the neuron ( dee learning)   
   5- Ensamble technique 
  

column == attribute = dimension = feature= variable 

if we are build the model with more attribute then overfitting problem comes 
	also if we train he model with high coefficient then also overfitting will arise 
	theats we are introduce regularization concept 

1- Regularization technique  
	regularize the coefficient of independent variable 
	
	ridge regression = ridge regualarization = l2 (scale down high coef - low coef)
 
	lasso regression = lasso regularization = l1 ( scale down high coef - 0 & Low coef) 
		l1 also called as feature elimination technique 

	elasticnet == l1 + l2

how to remove the attribute 
	1- RFE ( recursive feature elimination)
	2- lasso regression 
	3- pca

ML -- 
	slr we will predict future 
	mlr 
	regularization (l1, l2)
	gradient descend, stocastic gd, batch gd 
GD, SGD, BGD -- ml, dl, gen ai -- every where 
		technilca theory -- try to understand well 
		

gd is an optimization algorithm thats finds best fit line from training dataset 
gd graph alwasy plots in 3d diagram 


what happend if step size is equal 
step size in gradient descend is called learning reate or momentum in gradeint descent 
	learning rate alwasy be minimum -- 0.01 | 0.001 
	
GD we will be practicle implemention in ANN (ARTIFICIALL NEURAL NETWORK) 


big data gd is slow why it is slow
the reason we compute math indidiual sing recordins 

GD is an optimization algorithm to compute indivdual datapoint to reach global minima by reduce 
			cost function and increase accuracy 
			
SGD is an opitmization algorithm to compute random cluser datapoint and take mean to reach 
			global minima and increase accuracy 
			
BGD is an opmtizaton algorithm to compute batch wise cluse datapoint and take mean to reach 
			global minia and increase accuracy
		
practicle -- ann i will using (optimizer = sgd)

classification -- 

performance measure of regression -- R2, adjusted R2
performance measure of classification -- CONFUSION MATRIX 
MATRIX makes confusion | after my explanation no more confusion matrix 

TP ( True +Ve)
FP (False +Ve) | Type-1  
TN ( True -ve)  
FN (False -ve) | Type - 2 

actual table ( y_test)
predicted (y_pred) 
===
Model accuracy == (TP + TN)/ (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Model accuracy == (TN + TP) / TN + TP + FN + FP)
===
Error == 1 - accuracy 
fp + fn / tp+tn+fp+fn
===
precission == tp / predicted yes = 100/110 ( tp / tp+fp) 
recall = tp / actual yes = 100/105 (tp/tp+fn) 
===
f1 score == 2* (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

LOGISTIC REGRESSION -->
===

logistic regregsssion is classification or regression ? 

if classification --- why it is classification 
why regression -- why it is regression 

LOGISTIC REGRESSION --> sigmoid curve ( will implement prob function1/1+e-y) 
												it adjust outlier from the dataset 
Deep learning --> this sigmoid curve also we called as sigmoid activation function 

Range of sigmoid curve is 0-1 
Range of r2 0-1 
Range of corelation is -1 to 1
Range of min max scaler ( Noramlization ) 0- 1
z-score  -3 to 3 
Standarization -- mean 0 & sd - 1
Range of softmax 0- 1
Range of RELU - 0 to infine
Range of leeky relu - -1 to infinith
Range of tanh -1 to 1
Math for logistic regression

==== 30th 

machilearn classificate  2 algorithm comes probability 
	logistic & naive bayes 
logistic -- we used prob concept to outlier then only the outlier will adjust sigmoid curve 
naive bayes -- bayes theorem very powerfull	

logistic regression alsoc alled as maxent clasisfier or logit classifier 

why we called as maxent classifier ?? 


case-1:  y*mx > 0
case-2:  y*mx >0
cas3-3:  y*mx < 0( whene ever we got this situation datapoints are missclasify) 
					
logistic regerssion also called as max ent classifier 
sigmoid curve = 1 / 1+ e-y
